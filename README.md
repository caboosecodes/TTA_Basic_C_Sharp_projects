### Car Insurance Project
The Car Insurance Project is MVC project using the Entity Framework that simulates a car insurance website. The user is asked to fill out various datafields and, using business logic, an insurance quote is generated depending on the user's input. Also, there's an admin page where you can view the first names, last names, emails, and quotes generated.

### 21 Card Game
The 21 card game is a simple game of Blackjack. The user is prompted to enter in their name and the amount they want to gamble and then the game begins. Built with resuability in mind this game uses class inheritance, and it also handles exceptions in case anybody tries any funny business. It also logs and writes those exceptions to a database using ADO.NET.

### Code First Database
A simple .Net Core console application that uses Code First concept where a database is created based upon the classes you've written rather than creating a database and creating classes based around the database.

### Miscellaneous Files
You will also find various files related to assignments or challenges that I had completed while going through the C# and .NET course at The Tech Academy.
